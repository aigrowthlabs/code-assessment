# Travel Recommendation System

## Overview
Build an AI-powered travel assistant that provides personalized destination and activity recommendations. Users can input their travel preferences, and the system responds with intelligent recommendations.

## Time Allocation
**Total Time: 2-3 hours**

## Technical Requirements
- **Frontend**: Next.js with TypeScript
- **Backend**: Node.js + TypeScript
- **AI Integration**: Use any AI frameworks/libraries for processing and recommendations

## User Stories

### Core Functionality (MVP)
1. **User Input**: User provides travel preferences through web interface
   - "I want to visit somewhere warm in Europe next month"
   - "Find me a beach destination under $2000 for 5 days"
   - "I like adventure activities and good food, where should I go?"

2. **AI Processing**: System extracts key information:
   - Destination type/region
   - Budget constraints
   - Travel dates
   - Activity preferences
   - Weather preferences

3. **AI Response**: System provides recommendations with reasoning:
   - 2-3 destination suggestions
   - Weather information
   - Estimated costs
   - Activity highlights

### Enhanced Features (If Time Permits)
- **Voice Integration**: STT/TTS or STS using Vapi or OpenAI Realtime API
- Travel tips and cultural insights
- Best time to visit recommendations
- Flight price estimates
- Hotel suggestions

## AI Integration Requirements
We want to evaluate your ability to work with AI systems effectively. Your solution should demonstrate:

- **Natural Language Processing**: Extract meaningful travel preferences from conversational input
- **Prompt Engineering**: Design effective prompts for travel recommendation generation
- **Tool Calling/Function Calling**: Implement structured data retrieval (weather, destinations, costs)
- **AI Framework Usage**: Use any AI libraries you prefer (OpenAI SDK, Anthropic, Vercel AI SDK, etc.)
- **Context Management**: Maintain conversation context for follow-up questions

## Submission Requirements
1. **Source Code**: GitHub repository 
2. **Demo Video/URL**: Show voice interactions and AI reasoning
3. **Documentation**: Brief explanation of your AI integration approach

## Resources
- [Vapi Documentation](https://docs.vapi.ai/)
- [OpenAI Realtime API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/realtime)
- [Vercel AI SDK](https://sdk.vercel.ai/docs)

## Use of AI Coding Tools
**We encourage you to use AI coding assistants!** Feel free to use any AI tools to help with development:
- **Cursor** with Claude/GPT integration
- **Claude Code** (Anthropic's coding assistant)
- **GitHub Copilot**
- **ChatGPT/GPT-4**
- Any other AI coding tools you prefer

Using AI tools effectively is a valuable skill we want to see. Show us how you leverage AI to build better solutions faster.

## Important Note
**If you can't complete the project within the time frame, don't worry!** Send whatever you have accomplished - it doesn't need to be perfect. We're more interested in seeing your approach, code quality, and problem-solving process than a fully polished application.

## Submission
Please send your repository link and demo video/URL to: **talents@aigrowthlabs.com**
